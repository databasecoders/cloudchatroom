## Chatroom App

This chatroom app allows users to sign up and create a profile on the platform. When signing up, they can insert their username, email, password, confirmation password, bio and profile picture. That information is then stored in MySQL so that they can come back to the site and sign in with all of their profile information loaded to the page.
The app also allows all of the users to interact with one another on a global chat. Messages are then stored into Firebase so that a user can see a history of all of the messages on their browser.
Future versions will allow users to interact one on one, be able to add friends, and be able to upload multiple pictures to their profile which will allow their friends to like and comment on them.
